Differences between Node.js and the Browser:

1) In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies.
Those do not exist in Node.js, of course.
You don't have the document, window and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.

2)Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. 
Unless you are building an open source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the application on.
Compared to the browser environment, where you don't get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use, this is very convenient.
This means that you can write all the modern ES6-7-8-9 JavaScript that your Node.js version supports

3)Since JavaScript moves so fast, but browsers can be a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web you are stuck with using older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases.

4)Another difference is that Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.

5)From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage:
 the comfort of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single language.
